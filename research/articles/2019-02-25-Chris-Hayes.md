## Corruption

**Why aren't you high-dollar fundraisers like most politicians?**

So look, we`ve got a problem in democracy 
right now, and that is that money just has too much influence in 
Washington. And we have a chance right now in a Democratic primary, we're in a primary, it's Democrats against Democrats, to say here's how we're going to do this.

We're going to build from the grass roots. We`re actually going to build a foundation for the Democratic Party that is really about face to face, person to person, neighbor to neighbor people who are engaged in this campaign, whether they can give five - 50 bucks or thousands of dollars.

What we care about is that we have a whole movement of engaged people who are going to help us get elected, not just to the White House, but help us take Congress, help us take state houses, help us take the governor's mansions and help us have the momentum we're going to need to make the changes once we're elected.

This is about how we build real change and I`m excited about it.

**You did big ticket fundraisers when you ran to be a Senator.  Why did you do that then and this now?**

I've never actually been in a deeply competitive primary, I get it. Republicans come to the table armed to the teeth. They've got all of their donors, their wealthy, wealthy donors.

They've got their super PACs, they've got their dart money, they got everything going for them. And I'm just going to be blunt, I do not believe in unilateral disarmament. We've got to go into these fights and we got to be willing to win these fights.

**Does that mean that you'll take bigger checks when the general election comes around?**

Yes, but here's what I want you to see that's different about it, Chris, think about the difference once we're down to the two candidates. If the Democrats have spent the next year in a primary building this thing face to face, person to person, neighbor to neighbor across the country, think of the kind of foundation that we have laid down so that when we're really up against it in the general election, it's not just money to fund television ads, it's all the folks who will do the door knocking, it's all the folks who will make the phone calls, it's all the folks who will reach 
out to their network.

Because you know how we're going to win in 2020? It's going to be big, it's going to be people who voted for Donald Trump last time around, it's going to be people who haven't voted at all, it's going to be people who see a vision and a way to make this democracy work, not just for the rich and the powerful but make this democracy work for everyone.

The best estimates are that most candidates for office are spending about 70 percent of their time with millionaires and billionaires, spending it behind closed doors at fancy cocktail receptions and private dinners in mansions.

Let me tell you what I`m going to do tonight, I`m going to call time tonight.
