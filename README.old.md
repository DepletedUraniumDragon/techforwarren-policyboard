# policyboard
An interactive page to help voters learn about campaign policy proposals

- The core project structur here is the autogenerated output from [`create-react-blog`](https://github.com/jamesknelson/create-react-blog), which seemed interesting and potentially useful.  No work has happened in there, we could abandon this `src` if we wanted.
- Research is being tracked in [`/research`](./research/README.md)
- If you have ideas about interactive widgets to demonstrate how her policies will affect voters lives, [write them up in an issue](https://github.com/techforwarren/policyboard/issues/new)!
